Element Structure: The classes Obliviator, Auror, DepartmentHead, and MinisterForMagic represent elements in the object structure. These elements have the accept method that takes a visitor as an argument.
Visitor Interface: The visitor classes like VisitorForPrintingWizardNames and VisitorForPrintingHouseNames implement a visitor interface, which declares a visit method for each type of element in the object structure.
Concrete Visitors: Concrete visitor instances (VisitorForPrintingWizardNames and VisitorForPrintingHouseNames) define specific operations to be performed on the elements of the structure. Each visitor can perform different operations on an instance of the element it visits.
Accept Method: The accept method in the element classes allows a visitor to 'visit' the element. This method calls the appropriate visit method of the visitor, passing this as an argument.
Separation of Concerns: The pattern separates the algorithmic logic (contained in the visitors) from the objects (the ministry staff). This separation is beneficial for maintaining and extending the logic independently from the objects it works on.
In this scenario, the Visitor Pattern allows performing various operations (like printing wizard names or house names) on a set of ministry employees without changing the classes of those employees. This makes it easier to add new operations (just by adding new visitors) without altering the existing classes, showcasing the pattern's ability to facilitate operations on complex object structures in a flexible and maintainable manner.
