Director: The Director class plays the role of director in the Builder Pattern. It orchestrates the construction of a potion by first determining the available ingredients and then ensuring all necessary ingredients for a specific potion are available.
Concrete Builders: Classes like WitSharpeningPotionMaker, DraughtOfPeacePotionMaker, and LovePotionMaker can be considered as concrete builders. Each of these presumably implements a common interface (like PotionMaker) and knows how to create a specific type of potion.
Building Process: The director (Director class) controls the building process. It checks the availability of ingredients and then proceeds to instruct the builder (potionMaker) to create the potion once all necessary ingredients are gathered.
Complex Construction: The construction of a potion is complex and requires checking the availability of ingredients, possibly waiting for them to become available, and then combining them. This complexity is managed by the director, which encapsulates the logic and steps required to build the potion.
Flexibility: The Builder Pattern allows for flexibility in the construction process. Different types of potions can be created using different builders without changing the underlying construction process.
