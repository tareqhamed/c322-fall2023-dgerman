The code you provided demonstrates the Singleton design pattern in Java. The Singleton pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance. Here's what I understood from the code:

UnauthorizedInstanceException is a custom exception class that extends the Exception class. It is used to handle exceptions related to unauthorized creation of multiple instances of the Singleton class.
The Singleton class has a static boolean variable instanceExists that keeps track of whether an instance of the class has been created or not.
The constructor of the Singleton class throws an UnauthorizedInstanceException if an instance already exists (instanceExists is true). This prevents the creation of multiple instances of the Singleton class.
In the main method of the TestSingleton class, two attempts to create instances of the Singleton class are made.
The first attempt (obj_1) is successful, and it creates a unique instance of the Singleton class. If an exception were to occur, it would be caught and its message would be printed.
The second attempt (obj_2) tries to create another instance of the Singleton class, which causes an exception (UnauthorizedInstanceException) to be thrown since the Singleton pattern ensures that only one instance is allowed.
Overall, the code effectively demonstrates the Singleton pattern by preventing the unauthorized creation of multiple instances of the Singleton class and raising an exception if such an attempt is made.
