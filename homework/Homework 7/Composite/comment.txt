The Auror class in this Java code demonstrates the use of the Decorator Pattern in object-oriented programming. An Auror is a specialized type of Wizard with additional responsibilities and attributes, particularly in dealing with Death Eaters.

Key aspects of the Decorator Pattern illustrated in this code include:

Inheritance for Type Matching: The Auror class extends Wizard, meaning it inherits all the functionalities of a Wizard and is compatible with interfaces or methods expecting a Wizard object. This is a crucial aspect of the Decorator Pattern, allowing the decorated object to be used in place of the original object.
Enhanced Responsibilities: Auror adds new responsibilities (such as managing deathEatersAssigned and checking hasPreviousExperienceInDealingWithDeathEaters) on top of the base Wizard functionalities. This is characteristic of the Decorator Pattern, where additional features or behaviors are added to an object dynamically.
Conditional Behavior Modification: The method acceptOrderToCaptureDeathEater modifies the behavior based on certain conditions (e.g., checking if the Auror has previous experience or if the number of assigned Death Eaters is less than 5). This reflects the Decorator Pattern's ability to add behavior that is dependent on runtime conditions or the state of the object.
The Decorator Pattern is typically used to add responsibilities to objects dynamically without modifying their structure. In this scenario, the Auror class is a perfect example, as it builds upon the base Wizard class by adding specialized methods and properties relevant to Aurors, thus enhancing and extending the functionality of the base class without altering its core structure.
