In this Java code, SchoolOfMagic allows the Headmaster to choose between two styles of Defense Against the Dark Arts (DADA) teaching at runtime. Depending on the choice, either a TeacherNuovoForDADA (representing the new style) or a TeacherVecchioForDADA (representing the old style) is adapted through PluggableAdapterForDADATeaching. This design demonstrates the use of the Adapter pattern in a flexible and interactive way.
